                        <h2>Design and Ergonomics:</h2>
                        <img class="product-img" src="../images/product image" alt="">
                        <p >One of the standout features of the Logitech Trackman Marble is its unconventional design. Unlike traditional mice that require users to move the entire device across a surface, the Trackman Marble uses a stationary ball for navigation. This trackball design allows users to control the cursor with precision using their fingertips, reducing the need for large hand movements. </p>
                        <p>The symmetrical design of the Trackman Marble caters to both left and right-handed users, making it an inclusive choice. The ambidextrous design is complemented by a comfortable, contoured shape that promotes extended use without causing discomfort. The large marble-shaped ball sits in the center, and users can control the cursor by rolling the ball with their fingers.</p>
                        <h2>Features and Controls:</h2>
                        <p>The Trackman Marble features four buttons, providing a well-rounded set of controls for various tasks. The primary left and right buttons are complemented by a scroll wheel and a fourth button located near the thumb rest. The fourth button can be customized to perform specific functions, offering users a degree of personalization in their workflow.</p>
                        <p>The scroll wheel adds to the overall usability of the device, allowing for easy navigation through documents and web pages. The ball's responsiveness is adjustable, enabling users to find the ideal level of sensitivity that suits their preferences. This customization is particularly beneficial for users who require different cursor speeds for various tasks.</p>
                        <h2>Performance:</h2>
                        <p>The Logitech Trackman Marble's performance is commendable, especially for users who appreciate precision and control in their work. The trackball design eliminates the need for a large desk space, making it an excellent choice for those working in confined environments. The stationary ball also reduces the risk of repetitive strain injuries associated with traditional mice, as users can control the cursor without moving the entire device.</p>
                        <p>The optical tracking technology ensures smooth and accurate cursor movement, even on a variety of surfaces. The four buttons provide quick access to essential functions, and the customizable fourth button adds an extra layer of convenience for power users. Overall, the Trackman Marble excels in providing a reliable and efficient user experience.</p>
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>The Logitech Trackman Marble stands out as a unique and ergonomic alternative to traditional mice. Its trackball design, coupled with customizable features and a comfortable shape, makes it a compelling choice for users seeking precision and efficiency in their workflow.</p>
