                    <h2>How important is the type of switches in a gaming keyboard?</h2>
                    <p>Switches play a vital role in determining the tactile experience and responsiveness of keys. In the realm of gaming keyboards, mechanical switches are highly preferred due to their tactile feedback and quick actuation, giving gamers a clear advantage in competitive gaming. Cherry MX, Razer, and Romer-G are well-known switch types, each offering its own distinctive feel.</p>

                    <h2>What role does anti-ghosting and n-key rollover play in gaming keyboards?</h2>
                    <p>Anti-ghosting technology guarantees that you can press multiple keys at the same time without any missed inputs, which is essential for executing intricate gaming moves. On the other hand, N-key rollover takes it a step further by enabling each key to be registered independently, eliminating any input restrictions during intense gaming sessions.</p>
