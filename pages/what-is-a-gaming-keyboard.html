                    <h2>How important is the type of switches in a gaming keyboard?</h2>
                    <p> Switches are crucial as they determine how keys feel and respond. Mechanical switches are favored in gaming keyboards for their tactile feedback and faster actuation, providing a distinct advantage in competitive gaming. Cherry MX, Razer, and Romer-G are popular switch types, each with its unique feel.</p>

                <section id="section4">
                    <h2>What role does anti-ghosting and n-key rollover play in gaming keyboards?</h2>
                    <p> Anti-ghosting ensures that multiple keys can be pressed simultaneously without missing any inputs, crucial for complex gaming maneuvers. N-key rollover goes a step further, allowing every key to be registered independently, preventing input limitations during intense gaming sessions.</p>

                    <h2>Are RGB lighting and aesthetics just for show, or do they serve a purpose in gaming keyboards?</h2>
                    

                    <p>While RGB lighting adds a vibrant and customizable aesthetic, it can also be functional. Certain games or applications can integrate with RGB setups to provide visual cues or notifications. Additionally, some gamers find the dynamic lighting effects to be an immersive aspect of their gaming experience.</p>

                    <p>Wired keyboards generally offer lower latency and a more reliable connection, making them the preferred choice for competitive gaming. However, wireless technology has made significant strides, and some gamers appreciate the freedom it provides. Ultimately, the choice depends on personal preference and priorities.</p>
