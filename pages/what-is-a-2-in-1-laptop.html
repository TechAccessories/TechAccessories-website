                    <h2>How Does a 2-in-1 Laptop Work?</h2>
                    
                    
                    <p>The key feature of a 2-in-1 laptop is its ability to transform between two primary modes: laptop mode and tablet mode. In laptop mode, it functions like a typical laptop with a keyboard and trackpad. However, the hinge mechanism allows users to rotate or detach the keyboard, transforming the device into a tablet. This adaptability offers users the convenience of a laptop for productivity tasks and the portability of a tablet for entertainment and on-the-go use.</p>

                    <h2>What are the Different Types of 2-in-1 Laptops?</h2>
                    <p>There are two main types of 2-in-1 laptops: convertible laptops and detachable laptops.</p>

                    <section id="subsection3.1">
                        <h3>Convertible Laptops:</h3>
                        <p>These models feature a hinge that allows the screen to rotate 360 degrees, enabling a seamless transition between laptop and tablet modes. Users can fold the screen backward to use the device as a tablet or set it in tent mode for presentations and media consumption.</p>
                    </section>
                    <section id="subsection3.2">
                        <h3>Detachable Laptops:</h3>
                        <p>In detachable laptops, the screen can be completely separated from the keyboard to function as a standalone tablet. This design provides more flexibility, as users can choose to use only the tablet portion when touch input is preferred or reconnect it to the keyboard for a traditional laptop experience.</p>

                <section id="subsection4.3">
                    <h3>3. Touchscreen Capabilities:</h3>
                    <p>Most 2-in-1 laptops come equipped with touchscreen displays, enhancing the overall user experience. This feature is especially beneficial in tablet mode, allowing for intuitive navigation and interactive applications.</p>

                <section id="subsection4.4">
                    <h3>4. Productivity and Creativity:</h3>
                    <p>With the inclusion of a keyboard, 2-in-1 laptops maintain the productivity features of traditional laptops.
