                    <img class="product-img" src="/images/mice/trackball-mouse-image.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>A trackball mouse operates on the concept of a stationary body and a movable ball. Instead of moving the entire mouse, users manipulate the cursor by rotating the stationary ball with their fingers. This rotational motion is then translated into precise cursor control on the screen.</p>

                    <h2>How does a trackball mouse's rotation achieve precise cursor control?</h2>
                    
                    <p>The rotational motion of the trackball is detected by sensors inside the device. As the ball rotates, these sensors pick up the movement and transmit the corresponding signals to the computer. This information is then translated into cursor movement on the screen, allowing users to achieve precise control without the need for physical mouse movement.</p>

                    <h2>Trackball mouse design</h2>
                    
                    <p>Trackball mice have a unique design featuring a stationary body and a protruding ball. This design allows users to control the cursor without moving the entire device. The ball can be easily rotated with the fingers, providing a different approach to cursor manipulation compared to traditional mice.</p>

                    <h2>Advantages of a trackball mouse over traditional mice</h2>
                    
                    <p>Trackball mice offer several advantages over traditional mice. They provide enhanced precision, making them ideal for tasks that require fine control, such as graphic design or gaming. Additionally, the stationary design can be more ergonomic for some users, reducing the need for repetitive arm movements.</p>
