                        <h2>Design and Build:</h2>
                        <img class="product-img" src="../../images/Keyboards/Microsoft_Arc_Keyboard_+_Numpad-ergonomic-keyboard.jpg" alt="">
                    <p ><strong>Compact Form Factor:</strong> The Ducky One 2 Mini embraces a 60% layout, omitting the numpad, function row, and dedicated arrow keys. This design reduces the footprint, making it highly portable and suitable for users with limited desk space.</p>
                    <p ><strong>Sturdy Construction:</strong> Crafted with a robust plastic case, the keyboard offers durability. Despite its compact size, the One 2 Mini maintains a solid and substantial feel.</p>
                        <h2>Key Switches:</h2>
                        <img class="product-img" src="../images/Keyboards/Ducky One 2 Mini1.jpg" alt="">
                        <p><strong>Limited Switch Options:</strong> Users can select from various Cherry MX switches, such as Red, Brown, or Blue. While these are reliable mechanical switches, the range might not cater to users seeking more specialized options.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mechanical Switches:</strong> The keyboard utilizes mechanical switches, providing tactile feedback and a distinctive keypress sound characteristic of Cherry MX switches.</p>
                        <h2>Keycap Quality:</h2>

                        <p><strong>Double Shot PBT Keycaps:</strong>: The keycaps are made of double-shot PBT plastic, known for its durability and resistance to wear. The double-shot molding process ensures legends won't fade over time, enhancing the longevity of the keycap legends.</p>
                        <p><strong>Customization:</strong> Users can easily swap out keycaps for aftermarket options to achieve a unique and personalized aesthetic.</p>
                        <h2>RGB Lighting:</h2>
                        <img class="product-img" src="../images/Keyboards/Ducky One 2 Mini2.jpg" alt="">
                        <p><strong>Customizable RGB:</strong> The Ducky One 2 Mini is renowned for its RGB lighting capabilities. With customizable lighting profiles directly accessible on the keyboard, users can personalize the illumination to match their setup or preferences.</p>
                        <p><strong>RGB Effects:</strong> The keyboard offers a range of lighting effects, including reactive typing, color cycling, and more, enhancing the visual appeal during use.</p>
                        <h2>Connectivity:</h2>
                        <p><strong>Detachable USB-C Cable:</strong> Featuring a detachable USB-C cable, the keyboard facilitates easy transportation and cable management. Users can also replace the cable if needed.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>No Wireless Option:</strong> The Ducky One 2 Mini is a wired-only keyboard, lacking wireless connectivity options, which might be a consideration for users who prioritize a cable-free setup.</p>
                        <h2>Functionality and Controls:</h2>
                        <p><strong>Programmable Keys:</strong> The keyboard supports key reprogramming without the need for additional software. Users can define macros or reassign functions to suit their preferences.</p>
                        <p><strong>Function Layer:</strong> Due to the compact layout, some keys serve dual purposes through a function layer. This requires users to adapt to a non-standard layout, particularly if they rely heavily on dedicated arrow keys.</p>
                        <h2>User Experience:</h2>
                        <p><strong>No Dedicated Arrow Keys:</strong> With the absence of dedicated arrow keys, users may need time to adjust their typing and navigation habits. The arrow keys share space with other keys on the function layer.</p>
                        <p><strong>Non-Standard Layout:</strong> The compact 60% layout may pose a learning curve for users transitioning from larger keyboards, but it appeals to those seeking a minimalist and space-saving design.</p>
                        
                        
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>The Ducky One 2 Mini impresses with its compact design and customizable features. Ideal for enthusiasts valuing portability and style, this keyboard caters to those comfortable with its unique layout. For users seeking a blend of performance and aesthetics in a compact form, the Ducky One 2 Mini stands as a compelling choice.</p>
