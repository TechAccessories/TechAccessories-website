                    <h2>What is the Fundamental Concept Behind a Trackball Mouse?</h2>
                    <p>A trackball mouse operates on the concept of a stationary body and a movable ball. Instead of moving the entire mouse, users manipulate the cursor by rotating the stationary ball with their fingers. This rotational motion is then translated into precise cursor control on the screen.</p>

                    <p>The rotational motion of the trackball is detected by sensors inside the device. As the ball rotates, these sensors pick up the movement and transmit the corresponding signals to the computer. This information is then translated into cursor movement on the screen, allowing users to achieve precise control without the need for physical mouse movement.</p>
