                    <p>The key differentiator is the design. Ergonomic keyboards are shaped to fit the natural posture of the human body. They often have a split layout, allowing users to position their hands in a more relaxed and neutral position, minimizing strain and discomfort. Some models also incorporate negative tilt or tenting to further enhance ergonomics.</p>
